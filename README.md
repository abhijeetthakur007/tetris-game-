Another alternative would be to import the contents of the repository in a PyCharm project. The Pygame library can be installed in a virtual environment of PyCharm using the steps mentioned here.

# Running the application
Download the source code from the repository and run the file just as any other Python script (.py) file.

python3 Tetris.py
If the project is imported in PyCharm, then the file can be run directly by setting the appropriate configurations.

 # Note 
 The filepath and fontpath for the text files and fonts need to be updated according to the location of the project on the user's machine.
